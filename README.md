Este projeto permite a coleta e an√°lise de posts e coment√°rios do Reddit, armazenando os dados de maneira segura em um banco relacional PostgreSQL. Ele √© ideal para pesquisadores, analistas de dados e desenvolvedores que desejam extrair informa√ß√µes valiosas de comunidades online. Com consultas pr√©-definidas, √© poss√≠vel obter insights rapidamente, facilitando a an√°lise de tend√™ncias, identifica√ß√£o de padr√µes e integra√ß√£o com ferramentas de NLP para processamento avan√ßado de linguagem natural.

## üìå Vis√£o Geral

Um coletor de dados do Reddit que:

- Extrai posts e coment√°rios de subreddits (configur√°vel via vari√°vel de ambiente `SUBREDDIT_NAME`)
- Armazena os dados de forma segura em um banco PostgreSQL
- Oferece consultas pr√©-definidas para an√°lise de dados (retornando JSON)
- Est√° pronto para integra√ß√£o com NLP
- Possui tratamento de erros durante a coleta de dados

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clonar o reposit√≥rio

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glaubermag/reddit-scraper
cd reddit-scraper
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Criar um ambiente virtual (opcional, mas recomendado)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # No Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # No Windows
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Instalar as depend√™ncias

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configurar o arquivo `.env`

Crie um arquivo `.env` na raiz do projeto e adicione as seguintes vari√°veis:

```ini
DB_NAME=reddit_data
DB_USER=seu_usuario
DB_PASSWORD=sua_senha
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
SUBREDDIT_NAME=Python # Nome do subreddit a ser coletado
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Executar o script principal

```bash
python main.py
```

Sa√≠da esperada:

```bash
Coleta conclu√≠da. 5 posts armazenados.
```

Se ocorrer um erro, algumas mensagens comuns incluem:

```bash
psycopg2.OperationalError: could not connect to server: Connection refused
```
üí° **Solu√ß√£o:** Verifique se o PostgreSQL est√° em execu√ß√£o e se as credenciais no `.env` est√£o corretas.

```bash
KeyError: 'SUBREDDIT_NAME'
```
üí° **Solu√ß√£o:** Certifique-se de que o arquivo `.env` est√° corretamente configurado e cont√©m todas as vari√°veis necess√°rias.

```bash
python main.py
```

Sa√≠da esperada:

```bash
Coleta conclu√≠da. 5 posts armazenados.
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Modelagem do Banco de Dados

O banco de dados PostgreSQL segue a estrutura:

```sql
posts
‚îú‚îÄ post_id (PK)
‚îú‚îÄ url_post (UNIQUE)
‚îú‚îÄ titulo
‚îî‚îÄ ...

comments
‚îú‚îÄ comment_id (PK)
‚îî‚îÄ post_id (FK ‚Üí posts)
```

### ‚úîÔ∏è Por Que PostgreSQL?

- Suporte a JSONB para an√°lise de texto
- √çndices FULLTEXT para buscas eficientes
- Transa√ß√µes ACID para integridade dos dados

#### üìå Instala√ß√£o do PostgreSQL

- [Guia de Instala√ß√£o Oficial](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Cria√ß√£o do banco:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE reddit_data;
```

In Rio you define components as simple dataclasses with a React/Flutter style build method. Rio continuously watches your attributes for changes and updates the UI as necessary. Rio has per-component state management, while NiceGUI appears to use session state. (But not 100% sure)\n\n\nWith Rio, you don't need to learn CSS, Tailwind, Vue, or Quasar.\n\n\nBoth NiceGUI and Rio are valid options for smaller web apps. However, Rio might offer easier and more maintainable code as your project grows. It provides reactive state management and allows you to build complex, arbitrarily nested UI layouts with concise syntax.\n\n",

For example, the top-level components of your app start out using the \"background\" palette, but the contents of a button use the secondary palette. You can freely change all colors.\n\n\nIf you want more radical style changes, you can create components yourself, by combining more basic ones, like Rectangles - just like you'd do in the browser.
